The younger generation can finally see that it is possible to achieve goals that once seemed unattainable. Keryn McMaster emphasises the importance of social media in connecting female athletes by helping to promote female participation. In the 1970s and 1980s, women’s presence in sports was limited, even more so in sailing. At that time, Britain's Tracy Edwards (the first skipper of an all-female team in the Whitbread Round the World race and winner of the Yachtsman of the Year Trophy) made history with <em>Maiden</em>, but few women imagined they could follow in her footsteps. It was only when US sailor Dawn Riley took the helm of <em>Heineken </em>after her participation in the America's Cup, that sailing finally began giving the impression that it was opening its doors to women athletes. Despite this step forward, however, the sport remained a male-dominated world and many women were still left to watch from the sidelines. Over the years, Italy has seen the rise of Francesca Clapcich and Cecilia Zorzi, both female sailors flying the flag of inclusiveness, high-level female ocean sailing and more.</p>",

Emirates Team New Zealand had its ups and downs, managed to reach the semi-finals by a whisker, but unfortunately ended their try there.</p><p>As was only natural, once Emirates Team New Zealand had left the semi-finals, SLAM, as an Italian brand, also cheered on Luna Rossa as they competed in the final match against INEOS Britannia. It was great to see Giulia Conti at the helm again, with her 470 bowwoman Giovanna Micol, with whom she took part in the Beijing and London Olympics (with SLAM as the official supplier to the Italian Sailing Federation); Giulia also raced against her 49erFX bowwoman Francesca Clapcich (with whom she won European and World Championships in 2015 and took part in the Rio 2016 Olympics) who was at the helm of the NYYC American Magic Women's Team. Italy's final victory was the perfect redemption for Giulia Conti, who in four Olympics has never managed to claim a medal, despite being among the strongest and most eclectic helmswomen in the world. The Puig Women's America's Cup, in the final, brought her back to a speciality in which she is – also – among the strongest, so much so that she won silver at a women's Grade 1 Match Race in Florida in 2010. <br/><br/>All that remains is to congratulate the entire Luna Rossa team, who like Youth team deserved every ounce of the victory they achieved. For the girls onboard Emirates Team New Zealand, we hope the experience has only stoked their determination to continue with AC40 racing!</p>",
