Alessandra is capable of transferring her wealth of experience as an athlete and as a coach to Italyâ€™s under-19s, leading the Italian youth team to achieve exceptional results. Since covering this role, she has led Italy to win the Nations Trophy at the Youth Worlds an amazing three times (2016-2017-2023), having won gold herself in 1986 at the then IYRU Youth Worlds (now World Sailing) in Greece.<\/h3>"

A coincidence that allowed Alessandra to relive some of her most intense personal and sporting moments.Â <\/p><p>In this interview, we tried to understand what it takes to be a Youth Director; what decisions are needed in order to be prepared and motivated for the most important event on the calendar in a segment, that of the under-19s, that can be so delicate, and at times complex, but certainly stimulating due to the very age of the athletes competing, athletes who are given the opportunity to grow up in a highly formative reality. One thing is certain: medals (6 won in the last edition alone) donâ€™t just drop from the sky, they are earned through hard work, which starts from the basics, from the clubs, the coaches, all the way up to federal technicians and athletic trainers, whether at the club or from CONI itself. A chain of talent that, once it finds its balance and the right motivation, bears its fruits in the form of medals, victories, podiums. But <strong>first and foremost in the form of human and sporting experiences<\/strong>, which help young sailors mature with important values, such as <strong>believing in their team and giving it their all both as an individual and as a crew<\/strong>.<\/p>",

What I really liked about this year was that the kids were really motivated from the get-go: they waited for each other, helped each other out. This is key as a sense of being part of a team can truly make the difference.<\/p><p>Another key factor is that Italy has always managed to win when the event takes place in the southern hemisphere, towards the end of the year, having had time to prepare during the summer months, something that will not be the case this year on Lake Garda. For the previous team we knew we had very good individual athletes, demonstrated with victories at international championships, but it was essential to create a positive environment that could keep them focused on the event, while at the same time managing to make them have fun and experience it all with a bit of lightness. This is the balance that needs to be struck, the aim of the technical staff, who need to work alongside various figures and, in the months leading up to the event, contribute to achieving the goal.<\/p>",
