In the Cup’s 2000 edition, trimmer <strong>Lorenzo Mazza</strong> was among those onboard contributing to the team's success. After Luna Rossa's withdrawal from registration and participation in Bermuda back in <strong>2017</strong>, other Italian sailing personalities such as <strong>Max Sirena</strong>, <strong>Michele Ivaldi</strong> (navigator), and engineers including <strong>Guido Siri</strong> and <strong>Andrea Visintini</strong>, gave their support to the New Zealand team through their technical roles. Grinder <strong>Gilberto Nobili</strong> and hydrodynamics expert <strong>Davide Tagliapietra</strong> also made important contributions to the team. These names alone demonstrate just how central Italian sailing has been in the development of the Kiwi challenges over the course of recent years. And despite the current edition's more restrictive rules limiting international collaboration within the team, the Italian legacy and presence with <strong>Team New Zealand</strong> remains undeniable, making it a source of pride for Italian fans who are looking forward to their final against <strong>INEOS Britannia</strong>.</p>",
