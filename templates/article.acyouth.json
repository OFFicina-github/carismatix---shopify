We are used to considering water as a symbol of stillness, but in fact it’s hard as steel. And its splashes, while sailing, really hurt.  Water is thus an element that normally breaks sailors. From which they try to keep away, avoiding the hull to be more submerged than necessary. “In order to do that,” explains Caterina, “we need wind, which means freedom, fear, and firmness.”</p>",

Caterina Banti, born in Rome in 1987, has a philosophical kind of soul, guided by a humanistic approach. “I’m quite analytical too,” points out Caterina, “although for me control is not a lifestyle but mainly a method. A method I gained during my years as a student, ‘cause I really loved studying and succeeding at school and university.” She graduated very early, gaining the opportunity to access a PhD at the same time she first discovered sailing – “my brother needed a bowman and then I found out that I was good at it, having fun too.” She decided immediately to put her university career aside – “time was by my side indeed, I was very young and believed I could continue studying later on” – and focused on sailing, meeting Ruggero soon after. <br/>“In contrast, I started at a very young age,” he says, “moved by the most adrenaline-filled side of this sport. I also liked the stubbornness you need to put into practice what you learn, for instance in the way you need to take care of the boat. <br/>For this reason, I chose to graduate in engineering”.</p>",
