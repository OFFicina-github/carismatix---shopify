The young Kiwis didn't make it through to the semi-finals, but they did have the opportunity to experience a fantastic event, a spectacle that surely exceeded anything they could have imagined.</p>",

With the AC40s there we witnessed “acrobatics” not unlike those of a fast-paced video game, such was the ease and fluidity with which the young international sailing talents manoeuvred those flying mini-foils. Despite not being “foil natives,” the mastery and freshness demonstrated by all 12 teams made them certainly look as if they were.</p>",
