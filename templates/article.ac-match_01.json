Nathan, a true star of international sailing, began his Cup experience back in 2013, continuing in 2017 with Artemis Racing.</p><p>Ken Read, considered to be one of the most active spokesmen for sailing around the world, captured an insightful exchange of views between two sailing greats during a podcast, as Read himself was helmsman in two of Dennis Conner's America's Cup campaigns, in 2000 and 2003, aboard Stars & Stripes. As skipper, he competed in two Volvo Ocean Races: in 2008-2009 and 2011-2012, where he finished third. <strong>Nathan Outteridge </strong>compared his experiences between <strong>Artemis Racing </strong>in 2017 and <strong>Emirates Team New Zealand </strong>in 2024, highlighting the differences between an emerging team and an established one. With Artemis, a new team, under the leadership of Ian Percy there was still a lot that needed to be built, and delays often occurred during the development phases, which in turn affected the overall schedule.<strong> With Emirates Team New Zealand,</strong> on the other hand, with its much more<strong> mature and efficient structure, the integration process was faster and smoother, as the team demonstrated remarkable organizational skills and punctuality</strong>.</p><p></p>",

Emirates Team New Zealand, on the other hand, already took advantage of simulators then, prompting Artemis to develop one after that very campaign. In 2024, all teams use advanced simulators, balancing the time between simulation and water testing, thus improving the accuracy of their development stages.</p><p>Outteridge also reflected on joining a well-established team like Emirates Team New Zealand, acknowledging that although his was a much more predetermined role that left little room for independent initiative, he was happy to adapt to the situation, having learned from Peter Burling's experience. The two worked together closely to develop a common sailing style, demonstrating how cooperation within a well-structured team can be just as exciting as taking on a leadership role.</p>"

Having always been used to describing the tactical situation, as he did on the 49er, Nathan trained himself to provide clear information to teammate Peter Burling so that he could make quick decisions without losing speed.</p><p>Now, with the support of screens showing the surrounding context, boats and laylines, the task of gauging the situation has become much more precise, albeit requiring even clearer communication. The race software, common to all teams, displays the boats and course boundaries, while the sailors input the wind data they have collected to determine laylines. This helps the teams make tactical decisions based on real data and not just calculated assumptions they might have.</p><p>The system of vectors and “ghost boats” makes it possible to predict where boats will be in the next 10 seconds, facilitating the anticipation of manoeuvres and the evaluation of winning tactics in good time. In this way, assumptions are minimised and decisions are based on accurate data and precise projections.ts of the match, such as starts and manoeuvres.
