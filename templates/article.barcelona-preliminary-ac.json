However, everyone will be keeping an eye out to assess the other teams and the speed of their boats ahead of the start of the Louis Vuitton Cup on 29th August, when nothing will be held back. <\/p><p>From 22nd August onwards, teams will be able to begin forming an initial idea of who is faster and the boats’ conditions, of who can manoeuvre best in the before the starting line, what the top speeds will be. To date, no one can know the answers to these questions and even during the Preliminary Regatta there might be teams who adopt strategies, in which they deliberately avoid using specific technological aspects and their true speed, just to surprise their opponents when it really matters. All decisions that will be barely possible to distinguish from the outside. One thing, however, is certain: the Preliminary Regatta in Barcelona will be the most fascinating edition in the 173-year history of the America's Cup, a spectacle of boats, tech and speeds never seen before.<\/p>",
