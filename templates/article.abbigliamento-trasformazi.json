Inspired by that classic and chic style, SLAM immediately launched innovative products such as the sailor belt and the Sailing Jacket, first worn by Italian teams during the 1988 Sardinia Cup. <br\/>These products marked the birth of the Advanced Technology Sportswear (ATS) line, an avant-garde line that introduced advanced technical materials through continuous research and development, often conducted in close collaboration<br\/>with professional sailors. <br\/><br\/>A significant example from that era is the Twin Set Gear, a combination of jacket and salopettes with an internal mesh lining to maintain an air cushion between the condensation drops and the body. Today, the most advanced innovation in sailing garments can be found in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slam.com\/collections\/pro-collection\" title=\"https:\/\/www.slam.com\/collections\/pro-collection\">PRO Collection<\/a>. This line of technical garments is designed to offer maximum performance and protection for professional sailors.
