In just a short space of time, I found myself aboard carbon vessels, rubber dinghies and helicopters, following world-famous sailors and teams in some of the most prestigious regattas. It has been a truly unique experience for someone born from the plains, like me, moreover an architect by trade and not at all sporty by nature.<br\/> Perhaps, however, it was precisely the fact of having an architecture-trained gaze that helped me stand out: during a regatta in Porto Cervo, even Carlo Borlenghi noticed my photographs for their unique, unusual geometric construction and asked me to help him with Mascalzone Latino. Perhaps I spoke a somewhat different language in this mad world of sailors. <br\/><br\/>But if on the one hand, I was a little out of place in the world of the sea, having faced up to the most diverse selection of photographic genres over the years, on the other I always felt at home in Slam, where I found first and foremost a climate of great trust and, over time, true friendship. It takes trust to take an architect to the Caribbean, expecting him to come back from the sea with good photographs taken in 30 knots of wine and it takes trust to appoint him for so many years of photographic services of the collections.<br\/><br\/> But there was an underlying partnership that made things work so well: the idea that Slam should be told for what it was: a company made up of people with salt in their hair, calloused hands and tanned skin but who love the sea more than anything else and have a permanent smile on their face. And this is exactly how I see things and how I seek to use this magnificent language of image: as an opportunity to get to know the world and the people who live there, with transport and enthusiasm towards all possible diversities. With Slam, we have travelled and smiled together and I hope to be able to continue this wonderful journey for many years yet to come.”<\/em><\/h6>",
